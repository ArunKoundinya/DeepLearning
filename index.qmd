This website is designed to record my learnings on Deep Learning using Tensor Flow Framework. Since, website will be very handy to review even on a mobile compared to Jupyter Notebook.

The coding is done in python majorly using the following packages as of now:

-   Tensor Flow
-   numpy
-   Pandas
-   plotnine { Similar to that of ggplot of R }
-   dfply { Similar to that of tidyverse of R }
